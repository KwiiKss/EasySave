The class diagram is a simulation of our application and the different possibilities it offers to the user when using it.
By starting the application, the user will arrive on a welcome menu with the choice to choose a language. Then we come to the main page, you can choose between 3 options. we see what will happen if you move a file. The user then redefines his save path and the application saves the user's item in the right place.
he validates the blow.
and we see the model displacement file.
To quit the application, click on the cross.

#### Class Diagram

The class diagram follow the model (MVVM), we decided that the main interface could only create a Local object which would launch functions allowing the establishment of the backups/deletes/creations in complete safety as proposed by C# .

#### Activity Diagram

Our activity diagram allows us to follow exactly the options, choices and chains of actions that will be performed during the execution of EasySave
It also allows us to see at a glance the different features implemented and how they work.

### Diagram use case

![Use Case](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93580066/204036895-2816ec8a-f39b-498b-aaa7-f4346605f201.png)

Our Use Case Diagram aims to model our backup system. Thanks to it we can see the different possible interactions between the user, the system and the application (here a console).

We can therefore see that our user first enters our system via the console and from this point he is given the possibility of performing five major actions with options that result from them.

- **Exit**, will allow you to exit the console.
- **Change language**, will allow the alternation between French and English.
- Regarding **Open folder**, **Create Folder** and **Search folder**. These are only steps before accessing the most important features which are: file backup, file movement, file creation.

Note also the presence of **include** and **extend**:

- The extend is present between **Create works files** and **Write logs** because the logs are created automatically when creating or moving a file.
- For the include we find it between the **files** and the **folders** because it is possible to create, move, add a folder but this does not necessarily imply the creation or the movement of a file .
